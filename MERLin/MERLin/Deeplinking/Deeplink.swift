/**
 Make a Module subclass conforming this protocol to make that module
 automatically deeplinkable. The principle behind this automatic implementation
 is that to make a module deeplinkable should be simple enough and should not
 require additional code, and the list of available deeplinkable modules should
 reflect (and expand) accordingly to the modules built in the app.
 The removal or the addition of a Deeplinkable module **must** not affect the
 rest of the app. The list of available deeplinkable modules is built in runtime
 so that no maintenance is needed once the deeplink engin is built to be agnostic
 respect the modules that are going to be deeplinked. In this way, also god
 deeplink managers are avoided, and nobody knows how to build a module out of a
 deeplink, if not the module itself.
